        I live in Antwerp, Belgium and am passionate about all things PHP. I'm also a Laravel enthusiast and have used
        the framework on many projects.  Follow me <a href="http://twitter.com/cpdrenato">on twitter</a> to know what
        keeps me busy.
    </p>

    <p>
        Together with my buddies <a href="https://twitter.com/cpdrenato">Dries</a> and <a
                href="https://twitter.com/cpdrenato">Renato</a> I organise our local PHP user group <a
                href="http://phpantwerp.be">PHP Antwerp</a>. If you are ever in the area of our beautiful city and what
        to speak at our user group, let us know!
    </p>

        At Spatie we use a lot of open source software: PHP, Ubuntu, Laravel, Composer, Beanstalkd,… are a few of the
        things we use everyday. My company couldn't exists without open source software. That's why we try to give back
        as much as possible.
    </p>

    <p>
        Whenever we stumble upon a problem that we can solve in a clean way, we extract our solution for others to use.
        Together with my colleagues I regularly release <a href="https://spatie.be/opensource">PHP, Laravel and
            JavaScript packages</a>. Those packages have been downloaded a couple of millions times. Spatie is also
        ranked as number 2 on <a href="http://git-awards.com/users?language=php">Git Awards' list of PHP developers
            worldwide</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        I love public speaking and try to do it a lot. Here's a list of past user group meetups and conferences where I had the pleasure of speaking.
